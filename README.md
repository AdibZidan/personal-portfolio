# My Personal Portfolio

This project is live. Head over [here](https://www.adibzidan.com) to access it.

This repository includes my Portfolio, About Me and Task-Manager.

The Task-Manager is built using Angular 8 and is already CRUD ready.

For the Back-End, I'm using Node.JS; which is in a private repository.

## Instructions:

## Accomplishments:
